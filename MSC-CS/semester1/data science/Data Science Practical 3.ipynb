    "> Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning numerical descriptions of how likely an event is to occur, or how likely it is that a proposition is true. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, 0 indicates impossibility of the event and 1 indicates certainty. The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur.\n",

    "> In probability theory, conditional probability is a measure of the probability of an event occurring, given that another event (by assumption, presumption, assertion or evidence) has already occurred. If the event of interest is A and the event B is known or assumed to have occurred, \"the conditional probability of A given B\", or \"the probability of A under the condition B\", is usually written as P(A|B) or occasionally P<sub>B</sub>(A). This can also be understood as the fraction of probability B that intersects with A.\n",
